#lua-dev
A minimal Docker image based on Alpine Linux with lua-5.3, luajit (2.1.0-beta3) and luarocks-5.3
1. buildbase is included so that luarocks could build source rocks
2. git,bash,unzip,curl provide additional tools
3. lua-cjson is also included as json is key in most cases.

This is a test of rebasemerge.
